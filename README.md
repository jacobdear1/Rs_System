## Book Recommendation System

This contains a book recommendation system which recommends 10 meaningful recommendations to a user, 

### Dataset 
The dataset used is a Goodreads dataset and can be downloaded from here; https://mengtingwan.github.io/data/goodreads. I used the Mystery, crime and thriller one, which encapsulated reviews, books and interactions.
I mainly used the books and reviews to help inform my recommendations. 

### Approach 

#### RS1 - Basic
I used a hybrid approach of collaborative and content filtering. Content-based filtering uses a Vector Space Model (VSM) using the TF-IDF weighting scheme and uses cosine similarity to rate the similarity of books to a given user.
Collaborative filtering used SVD++, from the module surprise due to having better performance than SVD. The hybrid approach used a weighted average approach to give an equal chance to both methods. 
#### RS2 - State of the art
To further improve the recommendations, an NLP approach was utilised, namely a word2vec model, which gives a better understanding of semantic relationships.

### Metrics

precision@k and novelty were used to evaluate the performance of the 2, which proved RS2 gave better performance than that of RS1.

### How to run
`cli.py` and `recommender.py` allow you to run the basic recommender on the command line

`rs2_cli.py` and `rs2_recommender.py` allow you to run the state-of-the-art recommender on the command line. 

These can be run by `python cli.py`, `python recommender.py`, `python rs2_cli.py` and `python rs2_recommender.py`

You will then need to choose a `user_id` to generate recommendations for this. 

Note that both need additional files generated by running the `rs_system.ipynb`. So run the notebook.

### Future work
Integrate the interactions into the recommendations to help personalise more
